***Installation on Ubuntu:***


To install HashiCorp Vagrant on Ubuntu, follow these steps:
1. Update the Package List

First, update your package list to ensure you have the latest information on available packages.

        sudo apt update

2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies, including curl and gnupg.

        sudo apt install -y curl gnupg

3. Add HashiCorp GPG Key

Add the HashiCorp GPG key to your system to ensure the authenticity of the packages.


        curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg

4. Add HashiCorp Repository

Add the HashiCorp repository to your system's sources list.

        echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list

5. Update the Package List Again

Update the package list again to include the newly added HashiCorp repository.

        sudo apt update

6. Install Vagrant

Now, install Vagrant from the HashiCorp repository.


        sudo apt install -y vagrant

7. Verify the Installation

After the installation is complete, verify that Vagrant is installed correctly by checking its version.

        vagrant --version

This should output the version of Vagrant that was installed, confirming that the installation was successful.
8. (Optional) Install VirtualBox Provider

Vagrant requires a provider to create and manage virtual machines. The most common provider is VirtualBox. If you don't have VirtualBox installed, you can install it using the following commands:

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install -y virtualbox

9. (Optional) Install Additional Plugins

You can also install additional Vagrant plugins, such as vagrant-vbguest, which automatically installs the VirtualBox Guest Additions on the guest machine.

        vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
